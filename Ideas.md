// NEW PLAY BASED TIMER IDEA
// WHEN AUDIO IS DETECTED PAST A CERTAIN LEVEL THE TIMER TURNS GREEN AND STARTS COUNTING UP FOR 5 SECONDS - EACH TIME AUDIO IS DETECTED IT MARKS THE TIME AND EVERY 5 OR 10 SECONDS THE APP CHECKS TO SEE IF THERE WAS AUDIO IN THE LAST 5 TO 10 SECONDS AND IF SO IT KEEPS COUNTING
// IF NO AUDIO IS DETECTED FOR THE PAST 5 TO 10 SECONDS IT STOPS COUNTING AND TURNS RED

// HEADPHONES
// COULD HAVE AMAZON AFFILIATE LINKS ON HOW TO PURCHASE A SPLITTER SO HEADPHONES AND TABLET/PHONE/COMPUTER CAN BE PLUGGED IN TO THE PIANO AT THE SAME TIME

// finish every song per week? IF THE SONG HAS ALREADY BEEN PRACTICED THAT WEEK THEN DECREASE IT'S CHANCE OF BEING RESELECTED

// add a day off? SUNDAY?

// TODO When the user is selected query that users songs rather than grabbing all of them at the beginning
